Summary: 



> “Truth hurts, I know. It’s biologically-based, actually. Our brains process sound faster than they do light, but light moves faster than sound, see? So our brains are constantly shifting reality so the world syncs up. Only when someone is standing 30 yards away do we see and hear the world exactly as it is. That’s when your brain, sound, and light are all in perfect harmony. The rest of the time, we’re living in a world of lies. Lies are what make the world make sense. Ergo, the truth hurts.”
